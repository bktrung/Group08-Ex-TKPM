# Entity Logic Analysis - Academic Management System

## Overview
This document analyzes the entities in the academic management system, their business logic relationships, and dependencies for CRUD operations development. **Updated with actual service layer business logic analysis.**

## Entity Hierarchy & Dependencies

### 1. Independent/Foundation Entities (Easy CRUD)
These entities have minimal dependencies and can be created/updated independently:

#### **Department** 
- **Model**: Simple structure with just `name` field
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Current CRUD**: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE ✅
- **Missing CRUD**: None (Complete)
- **Complexity**: ⭐⭐ (Easy - but with validation)
- **Business Logic**: 
  - **Create/Update**: Checks for duplicate names
  - **DELETE Logic**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Checks for students/courses before deletion with cascade validation
